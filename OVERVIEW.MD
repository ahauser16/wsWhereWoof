# Project WhereWoof Resources

## I.  List project files (e.g. UDEMY tutorials, wyzant sessions, past bootcamp projects, etc.) that are useful resources.  Some code will need to be  refactored in order to work in a React Native environment which is necessary so that the project code can be transpiled to work on both iOS and Android devices.  

### I. Lecturer: Michael Miller
#### source: UDEMY
#### Course Title: "Display and analyze GIS data on the web with Leaflet"
#### Topics: JavaScript, jquery, turf.js, Leaflet, Open Street Map
#### Files Names: lectures 50, 55 and 62.
#### Summary: Miller specializes in geoJSON data mapping.  This lecture series covers many methods, plugins and background information used to map and manipulate data.  His use of methods from TurfJS and Leaflet libraries to plot markers, display data in a sidebar and the feature where he can determine if an oil pipeline (a polyline) intersects owl nests (markers with metadata) is especially useful.
#### TODO:
- [ ] Refactor Miller's JS to be React Native compatible.
- [ ] Cross-reference Miller's plugins and dependencies with current React Components to see if they are worth refactoring.
- [ ] List key source code with analysis.
